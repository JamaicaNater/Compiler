1. Alex Cummins CS4318 (jac822) , Francis Williams CS4318 (faw13), Course ID: CS4318

2. We plan to meet a few times each week to work on the project. Ideally we will meet in Alkek but when it floods we will have to meet in LBJ.

3. Both team memer worked collborativly on the the Assemble functions

4. We tested our code in two ways. By making our own extensive test cases and using MARS to trace the values through the funtion

5. the program was debugged using GDB and Mars version 4.5. Run the assembly code you can copy the assembly code in to mars (not spim) and run it. 
alternativly if you are using the provided makefile you can type "make compile"

Note: all funtions must have a return including voids

Bugs: you cant assign and declare in one step
	you cant pass array vals to funtions

6. When fuctions are called thier arguments are stored in memory then the function moves its stackpointer to just after the last argument passed.
The funtion then reads these in  and uses them as needed. Thus the fuction accepts any number of arguments.
